# BCMS Most

This project is connecting [BCMS Client](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-client) and [BCMS Backend API](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend) and providing useful tools for website frameworks like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/).

## Framework implementations

BCMS Most has its implementation for 3 major frameworks at the moment (this number increase over time):

- GatsbyJS - [gatsby-source-bcms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-bcms)
- NextJS - [next-plugin-bcms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-plugin-bcms)
- NuxtJS - [nuxt-plugin-bcms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-plugin-bcms)

Those packages are just wrappers around the BCMS Most. If your favorite framework is not listed, you can always make custom implementation using BCMS Most API.
